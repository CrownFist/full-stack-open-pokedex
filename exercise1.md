In Java, one of the popular choices for linting (at least on larger organizations) is sonarqube. It is an opensource platform. For testing purposes, JUnit seems to be a popular choice as it integrates with popular build tools like maven and gradle. Build tools (maven and gradle) seem to divide opinions. Maven is considered more standardized and easier to learn, whereas the gradle offers more options, with a price of steeper learning curve. Maven is recommended for "simpler" projects and Gradle for more complex solutions.

Popular runner-ups for Jenkins and Github actions seem to be GitLab CI and Drone CI. Many solutions seem to have free-tier options but the options are either limited, or advanced options are behind some premium-tier. In some conversations Jenkins is considered out-dated, but best option for self-hosted solutions. Gitlab and Github CI options seem to be a safe bet, and they have potential for upscaling. However if I would be developing in AWS or Azure enviroments, I would look into CI options meant directly for those cloud solutions. To summarize, one has to make the decisions based on the possible size of project, pricing, development enviroment. Free options seems to be either limited in options (or require much of setting up and maintenance), where as paid options are more streamlined and easy to setup.
